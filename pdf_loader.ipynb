INTRODUCTION\\nThe roots of agentic AI lie within the broader evolution of\\nartificial intelligence, dating back to early pioneers like Alan\\nTuring [1], who envisioned machines capable of exhibiting\\nintelligent behaviour and learning from experience. Using AI\\nagents for business management dates back to the work [3]\\nin 1998. Early AI systems sought to mimic human decision-\\nmaking but remained tightly constrained by predefined rules,\\nlacking true autonomy. Today, AI has evolved into dynamic\\nnetworks of independent agents capable of collaboration,\\ncompetition, and self-directed action. In the coming sections,\\nwe explore this transformative shift—unpacking the method-\\nologies powering agentic AI and showcasing its real-world\\nimpact.\\nA. WHAT IS AGENTIC AI? HOW IS IT DIFFERENT FROM\\nTRADITIONAL AI?\\nLet us begin with an example. Evolution of image classifica-\\ntion: from human labels to agentic AI. We will start with an\\nexample of classifying an image as a cat or dog. In early times,\\nhumans manually labeled images, an example of a fully hu-\\nman process. Then came assistive AI, such as Convolutional\\nNeural Networks (CNNs), which, once trained on labelled\\ndata, can automatically identify whether an image shows a\\ncat or a dog, see [36]. This is called \"assistive\" because the\\nAI supports human efforts—it performs a task when guided\\nand trained by humans but does not act independently. How-\\never, these models require human-labelled data and human\\nintervention for updates. Once deployed, assistive AI systems\\ncannot adapt or learn independently.\\nNow imagine agentic AI— in this context, an agentic AI\\ncould search the web for new data, adapt to new classes like\\n\"fox\" without explicit human retraining, and refine its model\\nusing techniques like reinforcement learning. This kind of AI\\ngoes beyond assisting—it acts with a degree of autonomy and\\ncan operate in dynamic environments with minimal human\\ninput.\\nIf we had to define agentic AI in one word, it would\\nbe ’proactivity’—the ability to anticipate, initiate, and act\\nautonomously toward goals. More formally, an AI system or\\nsoftware that can understand human problems, collect related\\ndata, use the data, and perform self-determined tasks to solve\\nVOLUME 11, 2023\\n1\\nThis article has been accepted for publication in IEEE Access.

Traditional AI systems are\\ntypically constrained by predefined rules and exhibit limited\\nadaptability, making them well-suited for narrow, single-task\\napplications. In contrast, agentic AI transcends simple reac-\\ntive behaviour by understanding complex environments, de-\\nvising multi-step plans, and autonomously pursuing defined\\ngoals. This proactive and strategic capability enables agentic\\nAI to effectively address dynamic, real-world challenges.\\nAs demonstrated by [2], such systems represent a signifi-\\ncant advancement over conventional AI verified by collected\\ninformation from around 500 organisations, with a 34.2%\\nreduction in completing the task, increasing the accuracy by\\n7.7%, and improving the resource utilisation by 13.6%.\\nCriteria\\nTraditional AI\\nAgentic AI\\nTask assignment\\nsolves task assigned\\nby human\\nsolves a task instead of\\nhuman\\nAutonomy\\nfollows\\npredefined\\ntasks\\nautonomous and able\\nto make decisions\\nLearning capability\\nlimited\\nlearning\\nby\\ntraining data\\ncontinuous and evolv-\\ning\\nBehavior\\nreactive\\nproactive\\nInput dependency\\nmanual input required\\nself initiating\\nScope\\nsingle task focused\\norchestrated\\nworkflows\\nTABLE 1. Difference between Traditional AI and agentic AI\\nB. CONFUSION BETWEEN AI AGENTS AND AGENTIC AI.\\nThe confusion between AI agents and agentic AI stems from\\ntheir hierarchical relationship [94]: AI agents are specialised\\ncomponents designed to perform single tasks. Agentic AI is\\nan autonomous system that dynamically orchestrates multiple\\nagents to achieve broader goals. For example, an AI agent\\nin medical imaging might be a CNN that classifies tumours\\nin scans—nothing more. In contrast, an agentic AI system\\nwould integrate multiple such agents (e.g., one fetching pa-\\ntient history, another cross-validating MRI and X-ray results,\\nand a third alerting doctors) into a cohesive, goal-driven\\npipeline. Think of AI agents as bricks and agentic AI as the\\nentire house: the former perform fixed tasks, while the latter\\ndynamically coordinates and adapts those tasks to achieve\\ncomplex objectives, such as end-to-end diagnosis. Agentic\\nAI is a unified platform that seamlessly connects AI agents\\nwith human users to facilitate smooth collaboration. Adaptive\\ntools and dynamic services enable AI systems to learn, adapt,\\nand work together, significantly enhancing their capacity to\\naddress complex, real-world problems. The following table 2\\nsummarises their distinctions and functional boundaries.

Difference between AI agents and agentic AI\\nC. ORGANISATION OF THE PAPER\\nThis paper discusses agentic AI systems through five key\\nlenses: foundations (core principles of agentic AI) in sec-\\ntion III, methodologies (design frameworks and learning ap-\\nproaches) in section IV, applications (industry-specific im-\\nplementations) in section V, societal impact (workforce trans-\\nformation and ethical risks) in section VI and the challenges\\nand opportunities VII. We analyze how autonomous decision-\\nmaking technologies evolve, where they deploy, and what\\ntheir consequences are for human systems.\\nII. LITERATURE SURVEY\\nAgentic AI does not need human intervention or works with\\nminimal human intervention. Another way to describe agentic\\nAI is autonomous AI, which can set goals, make decisions,\\nand take actions independently to achieve a goal or com-\\nplete a task without human intervention. Despite its grow-\\ning significance, from autonomous research agents to self-\\noptimising business processes, there remains a striking lack\\nof readily available and understandable materials dedicated to\\nthe subject. While foundational concepts are scattered across\\nreinforcement learning (RL), human-AI collaboration, and\\nlarge language model (LLM)-based agent frameworks, no\\ncomprehensive textbooks, standardised courses, or beginner-\\nfriendly guides exist to unify these ideas under the umbrella\\nof agentic AI. Current materials either focus narrowly on\\nsubfields (e.g., RL) or assume advanced technical expertise,\\nleaving researchers and practitioners to piece together in-\\nsights from fragmented research papers, GitHub repositories,\\nand experimental projects. Recent works such as [14] and\\n[13]’s survey article and [15]’s review of agentic AI systems\\nin computer vision remain among the few systematically\\norganised resources published to date.\\nA. LIMITATIONS OF EXISTING STUDIES\\nAgentic AI is an emerging and rapidly evolving field that de-\\nmands systematic exploration due to its potential to create au-\\ntonomous, goal-driven, and context-aware systems. We will\\nmention a few existing pieces of literature in this direction.\\nDeng et al. [8] discuss the security challenges faced by agen-\\ntic AI systems, for example, execution complexity, different\\nenvironments of operation, and uncertain user inputs.\\n2\\nVOLUME 11, 2023\\nThis article has been accepted for publication in IEEE Access.

They analyzed different evaluation metrics, recent\\nprogress in chemistry and biology, and different datasets used\\nfor the tasks. They have also discussed the challenges and\\nrisks of using agentic AI systems in the science and medical\\ndomains. Schneider et al. [10] compared the characteristics\\nwhich differentiate GenAI and agentic AI and discussed\\nhow agentic AI remedies the limitations of GenAI. Ferrag\\net al. [11] explored different benchmarks, frameworks, and\\napplication challenges related to the agentic AI use cases\\nin large language models. Acharya et al. in [14] covered\\nthe foundational concepts and methodologies of agentic AI\\nand its applications in different fields. Jisna et al. in [93]\\ndiscussed the technologies used in agentic AI, the advantages\\nit brings, and the challenges it brings. They concluded with\\nreal-world implementations of these systems.

[7] focused on how AI agents can\\nbe embedded in virtual and physical environments to do\\nmultimodal tasks. Joshi [13] discussed many frameworks\\nlike LangGraph, AutoGen, OpenAI Swarm abd other used in\\nagentic AI systems.\\nWhile a few comprehensive and insightful studies have\\nlaid foundational work in this area , the broader research\\nlandscape still shows notable gaps. In the following points, we\\nhighlight key limitations observed across existing literature.\\n1. Comparison with the traditional AI and with AI\\nagents Many papers do not make a clear distinction\\nbetween traditional AI systems and agentic AI systems,\\nleading to conceptual overlap and reduced clarity in\\nevaluating their unique contributions [93], [91], [11],\\n[14], [15], [13], [8]. In contrast, articles [9] and [10] have\\naddressed this, but they did not compare the AI agents\\nand agentic AI.\\n2.\\nMethodologies, Technologies, and working Although\\na few works discuss methodologies and technologies\\nused for designing these systems [93], [91], [14],\\n[11], [7], several others ignored these [15], [13], [9],\\n[8]methodological foundations. None of them except\\n[10] and [90] clearly explained the internal workings of\\nagents.\\n3.\\nType of AI agents, Applications Some studies cate-\\ngorize different types of agents [93], [14], [7], [15],\\n[10], but many papers [90], [91], [13], [8] omitted to\\nmention this. All articles except [90] and [9] mentioned\\nthe applications of agentic AI systems.\\n4.\\nImpact on labor and society The implications of agen-\\ntic AI on employment, social structures, and ethics are\\noften overlooked despite their growing importance; as\\na result, it is discussed only in [14] and ignored by all\\nothers.\\n5.\\nChallenges and open problems Although several stud-\\nies have acknowledged the challenges faced in adopting\\nagentic AI systems, few studies clearly articulate unre-\\nsolved questions [90], [11], [14], [13], [8], [9].\\nThis gap motivated us to create a structured literature review\\nto bring together principles, methodologies, and challenges\\nrelated to agentic AI in one place and make agentic AI more\\napproachable for rigorous study and real-world application.\\nIII. FOUNDATIONS OF AGENTIC AI\\nAgentic AI systems are built on core capabilities like au-\\ntonomy, adaptability, and goal-orientated plans. These agents\\noperate through perception, reasoning, action, and collabora-\\ntion. They are categorized by functionality—reactive, goal-\\nbased, utility-driven, and self-improving—each with distinct\\noperational paradigms.\\nA. THE CORE TRIAD OF AGENTIC AI CAPABILITIES:\\nAUTONOMY, ADAPTABILITY, GOAL-DIRECTEDNESS\\nFIGURE 1. Features of agentic AI\\nThree main features that define agentic AI are autonomy,\\nadaptability, and goal orientation. We will see an example\\nspecific to self-driving cars.\\nAutonomy : acting independently without human input. In\\nself-driving cars, autonomy manifests as the vehicle’s ability\\nto independently perceive its environment through sensors\\nlike cameras and LiDAR, process real-time data about traffic\\n4\\nVOLUME 11, 2023\\nThis article has been accepted for publication in IEEE Access.

HOW DO AI AGENTS WORK?\\nAgentic AI operation is described through different phase-\\nbased models—some outline four phases (data collection →\\ndecision →learning →collaboration), while others break it\\ninto five (perceive →reason →act →learn →collaborate).\\nThese variations are functionally equivalent, not contradic-\\ntory. ‘Perception’ encompasses data collection and interpreta-\\ntion, while ‘decision-making’ combines reasoning and action.\\nFor simplicity, we will adopt the four-phase framework in\\nour discussion. Agentic AI collects data, makes decisions\\nFIGURE 2. Agentic AI working\\nautonomously, and adapts to new inputs—a core mantra we\\nhave reiterated to underscore its transformative nature. Now,\\nlet us dive deeper: how does it work?\\nStep 1: Data collection – Agentic AI continuously mon-\\nitors its environment, collecting data—be it text, images, or\\nreal-world signals—that align with its goals. Just as a self-\\ndriving car uses LiDAR and cameras to perceive its surround-\\nings, agentic AI employs large language models (LLMs)\\n[4] and natural language processing (NLP) to interpret and\\ncontextualise information, converting raw inputs into mean-\\ningful, actionable insights.\\nStep 2: Decision Making – Once information is collected,\\nagentic AI evaluates the context and determines the most\\nappropriate action. For instance, a self-driving car processes\\nreal-time data—such as a pedestrian suddenly entering the\\nroad or slippery conditions from wet pavement—to decide\\nwhether to brake, change lanes, or notify the passenger. It can\\nalso explain its reasoning through onboard displays or voice\\nfeedback, enhancing transparency.\\nStep 3: Learning- Agentic AI continuously improves\\nthrough experience. Over time, its responses become more\\naccurate and reliable. A self-driving system, for example,\\nrefines its behaviour by analysing near-miss events, adapting\\nto local driving habits (e.g., aggressive vs. cautious traffic),\\nand updating its risk models after each journey to minimise\\nfalse positives and ensure smoother operation.\\nStep 4: collaboration - Agentic AI goes beyond perform-\\ning isolated tasks—it facilitates collaboration among multi-\\nple AI agents and fosters meaningful interaction with hu-\\nman users. This stage emphasises coordinated behaviour and\\nhuman-AI synergy. In the context of self-driving cars, for ex-\\nample, a fleet of autonomous vehicles shares real-time infor-\\nmation—such as accidents or traffic conditions—through a\\ndecentralised network. This collective awareness allows each\\ncar to reroute and optimise navigation proactively. Passengers\\nare informed through timely alerts like \"Traffic congestion\\nahead—rerouting to a faster path.\"\\nThese four phases—data collection, decision-making,\\nlearning, and collaboration create a self-sustaining loop of\\nautonomous intelligence. Much like a self-driving car that\\nbecomes more adept with every mile and enriches a broader\\ninnovative mobility ecosystem, agentic AI evolves through\\nongoing interaction with its environment and exchanging\\ninsights across systems.\\nC. DIFFERENT TYPES OF AI AGENTS IN AN AGENTIC AI\\nSYSTEM\\nThere are different ways of classifying agentic AI systems.\\nOne can classify according to architecture, learning capacity,\\ninteraction paradigm, or domain specialisations.\\nArchitecture-based classification categorizes agentic AI\\nsystems based on their underlying decision-making frame-\\nworks. Reflex agents work with predefined rules and do not\\nremember past actions. They only react to current inputs.\\nFor example, an emergency brake system can be activated\\nwhen it detects an obstacle. Next are the model-based agents,\\nwhich maintain an internal model to handle the observations.\\nFor example, considering the recent traffic, a self-driving\\ncar learns to keep the distance between other vehicles. Then\\ncome the goal-based agents, which plan actions to achieve\\nobjectives. They can handle complex and multi-step prob-\\nVOLUME 11, 2023\\n5\\nThis article has been accepted for publication in IEEE Access.

Vehicles can choose the shortest path to reach destina-\\ntions. The next one is utility-based agents, which extend the\\ngoal-based agents but choose actions that maximize expected\\nutility, e.g., profit, time, fuel cost, etc. Here, not only is it\\nconsidered the shortest path, but it also takes time, comfort,\\ntraffic, and everything else into consideration while driving.\\nLearning agents improve performance autonomously through\\nreinforcement learning. Can learn self-parking, using a his-\\ntory of passenger behaviours, considering travel time. The\\nlast one is meta-reasoning agents, which can modify their\\nlearning process and choose different algorithms and best\\nhyperparameters. Can handle unseen scenarios like off-road\\ndriving to avoid real-time traffic.\\nFIGURE 3. Classification of AI agents\\nAI agents are also classified according to the interac-\\ntion paradigm: how they engage with other agents and\\nhumans. The AI agents work independently at the simplest\\nlevel, performing the self-contained tasks known as single-\\nagent systems. For example, playing chess or filtering spam\\nare single tasks. More complex agentic AI systems where\\nmultiple agents interact in either hierarchical (top-to-down)\\nor flat (peer-to-peer) are called multi-agent systems. These\\nsystems suit more complicated challenges like maintaining\\nsupply chain management and coordinating centrally with\\nAI agents. In contrast, swarm systems rely on decentralised\\ncoordination. These systems are particularly well suited for\\ndynamic environments where simple rules lead to complex\\nemergent behavior, as seen in sensor swarms or disaster\\nresponse bots. Finally, human-AI collaborative systems in-\\nvolve human-AI interaction. Varying from assistive roles in\\nmedical diagnoses to managing traffic. These paradigms sup-\\nport shared decision-making and are critical in high-stakes\\ndomains where ethical oversight and human judgment are\\nessential.\\nAI agents can be classified based on their applications\\nin different domains, as different domains will require dis-\\ntinct capabilities and ways of implementation. Industrial AI\\nagents operate in manufacturing sectors. They excel in qual-\\nity inspection and robotic assembly, and their architecture\\ncombines reflex actions with model-based predictions. So-\\ncial agents, such as customer service, are used for human\\ninteraction. They primarily emphasize NLP and emotional\\nintelligence. They use advanced learning algorithms to adapt\\nto user behaviour. Tactical AI agents are employed in emer-\\ngency response, for example, in the defense and security\\nsectors, prioritizing rapid decision-making, coordinating with\\nhuman operators, and having goal-orientated architectures.\\nOrchestrator AI agents are used in complex systems like real-\\ntime traffic management. Their strength lies in utility-based\\nlearning. Scientific AI agents are used in research such as\\ndrug discovery. They have strong analytical skills, and they\\nuse meta-reasoning.\\nIV. TECHNOLOGIES AND METHODOLOGIES\\nThis section explores the core technologies enabling agen-\\ntic systems—including NLP for reasoning, RL/IRL for au-\\ntonomous learning, MAS for coordination, and neurosym-\\nbolic integration—alongside key methodologies like agent\\ndesign frameworks (BDI, SOAR) and evaluation through sim-\\nulation environments and robustness metrics. These compo-\\nnents form the technical backbone of intelligent, goal-driven\\nagents.\\nA. TECHNOLOGIES IN AGENTIC AI SYSTEMS\\nAgentic AI depends on cutting-edge technologies, which give\\nit core functionalities like autonomy, adaptability, and collab-\\noration. In this section, we will discuss some core technolo-\\ngies that lay the foundation of the agentic AI system.\\nNatural language processing and speech recognition are\\nused to understand natural language, make communication\\npossible, and help with reasoning and text summarisation.\\nTechnologies like large language models (LLMs), Claude,\\nand Whisper are integrated into agentic AI. These technolo-\\ngies help break complex goals into small tasks. For example,\\nan LLM agent can assign tasks to a warehouse robot or\\ndelivery drone in supply chain management.\\nReinforcement Learning (RL) and Inverse Reinforce-\\nment Learning (IRL) are the foundational technologies in\\nthe agentic AI system. RL and IRL enable AI agents to learn\\nfrom interacting with their environment. Each action of AI\\nagents receives positive or negative feedback and helps refine\\ntheir policies. RL focuses on agents learning optimal policies\\nthrough trial-and-error interaction with the environment. It is\\npowerful in tasks like game playing and robotics but often\\nrequires massive data and suffers in sparse-reward scenarios;\\nsee [128] and [129]. Deep reinforcement learning combines\\nthe idea of RL and neural networks, allowing AI agents to\\nhandle more complex and critical tasks. Inverse Reinforce-\\nment Learning (IRL) flips this paradigm: instead of learning\\nfrom rewards, the agent infers the underlying reward function\\n6\\nVOLUME 11, 2023\\nThis article has been accepted for publication in IEEE Access.

This\\nis particularly useful when defining explicit reward functions\\nis challenging, such as learning driving habits by observing\\nhuman drivers.\\nImitation learning(IL) plays a pivotal role in building\\nagentic AI systems; see [48], [49], [130], and [132]. In IL\\nagents learn behaviours directly from expert demonstrations\\nwithout requiring an explicit reward function, making it a\\npowerful alternative to Reinforcement Learning (RL) and\\nInverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL). It is particularly valu-\\nable in complex, real-world environments where designing\\nreward functions is difficult, for example, in robotics, where\\nrobots learn manipulation tasks from human demonstrations,\\nand in healthcare, where clinical decision support systems\\nimitate expert diagnoses and treatment paths. There are two\\nmain approaches of IL one is behaviorial cloning (mapping\\nstates to actions), see [70], [71] and dataset aggregation (iter-\\natively correcting mistakes by an expert) see [72], [73].\\nMulti-agent systems (MAS) and swarm intelligence\\nframeworks are the core principles that support the coordi-\\nnation and communication between multiple agents. Some-\\ntimes, these multi-agents compete with each other to improve\\nperformance. For example, collaboration becomes crucial in\\nswarm robotics or any decentralized AI ecosystem. Technolo-\\ngies like JADF (Java Agent Development Framework) are\\nused to accomplish MAS. Swarm algorithms like Ant Colony\\nOptimisation (ACO) and Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO)\\nare used for rerouting, load balancing, and search and rescue\\noperations.\\nNeurosymbolic integration for reasoning: this combines\\nsymbolic AI with neural networks. The neural network helps\\nto learn the pattern from the data, while symbolic AI con-\\ntributes to logical reasoning. Together, they help in adap-\\ntive learning, explainable decision-making, and learning from\\nlimited data. Techniques like differential logic, IBM’s neu-\\nrosymbolic concept learner, and neural theorems are used to\\nachieve this goal.\\nOther essential technologies used in agentic AI systems are\\nknowledge graphs and ontologies, a structured representa-\\ntion of domain knowledge. Its purpose is to help in semantic\\nsearch, task planning, and reasoning. Computer vision and\\nsensor fusion are used for visualising the physical world\\nand collecting information. This uses CNNs, LiDAR inte-\\ngration, and SLAM (simultaneous localisation and mapping).\\nAutonomous planning and scheduling algorithms help in\\nlong-term goal reasoning and task sequencing. STRIPS and\\nHierarchical Task Network (HTN) technologies are used in\\nthis case. In agentic AI systems, human-AI interaction tech-\\nnologies like explainable AI (XAI) and augmented reality\\n(AR) are used for collaborative decision-making and trans-\\nparency.\\nB. METHODOLOGIES IN AGENTIC AI SYSTEMS\\nAgent design frameworks: Sometimes agentic AI systems\\nare built using formal architectures. We will note a few of\\nthem. Belief Desire Intention(BDI) is a framework where\\nhuman reasoning inspires decision-making; see [77], [78].\\nHere, beliefs represent knowledge, desires are goals, and\\nintentions are committed plans. It excels in handling com-\\nplex, goal-directed behavior in dynamic environments, trans-\\nparent reasoning, enhanced learning, and easy integration\\nof AI techniques. However, BDI faces scalability issues as\\nagent populations grow, and implementing effective decision-\\nmaking in complex, uncertain environments remains chal-\\nlenging. Typical use cases include autonomous robots, digital\\nassistants, and multi-agent coordination tasks where explain-\\nability and rational planning are crucial. SOAR is a rule-\\nbased architecture designed for general intelligence, inte-\\ngrating learning, problem-solving, and decision-making in a\\nunified system; see [74], [75] and [76]. SOAR is a rule-based\\narchitecture for cognitive modeling, supporting hierarchical\\ntask decomposition. Its strengths lie in structured knowledge\\nrepresentation and efficient task execution. It lacks flexibil-\\nity in uncertain and large-scale environments and requires\\nextensive manual rule engineering, making it computation-\\nally inefficient. SOAR is often applied in training simula-\\ntions and procedural task automation. Adaptive Control of\\nThought—Rational (ACT-R) is a cognitive architecture that\\nmodels human thought processes by integrating symbolic and\\nsub-symbolic computations to simulate perception, memory,\\ndecision-making, and learning; see [79], [80]. It has a declar-\\native memory (for factual knowledge), a procedural mem-\\nory (containing production rules), a buffer (for temporary\\nstorage of information), modules (for perception, action, and\\noperation), and a sub-symbolic process (governs learning and\\ndecision-making). The psychologically plausible and hybrid\\napproach of combining symbolic and sub-symbolic reason-\\ning are the strengths of ACT-R. ACT-R is computationally\\nexpensive, and it struggles when rapid responses are needed.\\nThey are used in cognitive modeling, human-computer inter-\\naction, and human-like AI agents. ACT-R is primarily used in\\nresearch.\\nSimulation and training environments: Agentic AI sys-\\ntems require extensive training in safe and controlled environ-\\nments before being deployed in the real world. The goal is to\\naccelerate learning, minimize real-world risks, and minimize\\nethical concerns by exploring, experimenting, and learning\\nfrom mistakes before real-world experimentation. Several\\nplatforms facilitate such training. Unity ML agents provide\\na realistic 3D environment and support multi-agent training\\nusing the Unity game engine: see [81], [82]. It enables agents\\nto use reinforcement learning and imitation learning. Self-\\ndriving cars and robots are trained using Unity ML. OpenAI\\ngym, developed by OpenAI, is a benchmarking toolkit for\\ndeveloping and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms\\nsee [85], [86]. It provides a diverse collection of standardized\\nenvironments—ranging from simple tasks like balancing a\\npole to more complex video games. OpenAI Gym is a foun-\\ndational RL research and education resource, enabling repro-\\nducible experimentation. Mesa is a framework designed for\\nmulti-agent-based modeling, see [87], [88]. Mesa simulates\\ninteractions between multiple agents in a shared environment.\\nVOLUME 11, 2023\\n7\\nThis article has been accepted for publication in IEEE Access.

Informed Decision-\\nMaking: agentic AI processes vast data in real-time, uncover-\\ning patterns and forecasting outcomes to enable faster, data-\\ndriven decisions. Human-AI Collaboration: Rather than re-\\nplacing employees, agentic AI enhances human performance\\nby working alongside teams, increasing productivity and en-\\ngagement.\\nA. ROBOTICS: AUTONOMOUS DRONES, COLLABORATIVE\\nROBOTS (COBOTS)\\nAgentic AI is progressing substantially in robotics because\\nof its autonomy and adaptability. Agentic AI transforms how\\nrobots are deployed in real-world settings, particularly in\\naerial navigation and human-robot collaboration domains.\\nOne of the most prominent applications is in autonomous\\ndrones. These drones, guided by agentic AI, can navigate\\ndynamic and complicated environments without human in-\\nvolvement. For example, these drones can identify pertinent\\ninformation and transmit it to rescue teams in areas affected\\nby disasters. In agriculture, they can monitor crop health and\\nidentify areas affected by pests or drought. In logistics, they\\ncan deliver packages in the airspace, increasing efficiency and\\nsafety.\\nAnother key application is found in collaborative robots,\\nor cobots [12], [16], [17], which work alongside humans in\\nshared environments. These robots use agentic AI to adapt\\nto human behaviour in real time. In hospitals, surgical cobots\\nare being used to assist doctors. Cobots in a supply chain work\\nwith human laborers by helping them sort and transport, etc.\\nIn all these scenarios, agentic AI empowers robots to be\\nmore than just AI tools—they become intelligent collabora-\\ntors capable of achieving complex goals. With the ability to\\nlearn from experience, adapt to new conditions, and operate\\nautonomously, agentic AI is reshaping the future of robotics\\nacross industries.\\nThese are a few notable research works related to these\\nareas. Oertel et al. in [5], discusses key factors in engagement\\nresearch. Hou et al. introduced a bionic visual encoder instead\\nof a deep neural network for mobile robotic platforms like\\nhumanoid robots and drones [6].\\nB. HEALTHCARE: DIAGNOSTIC AGENTS, PROACTIVE\\nCOORDINATION\\nAgentic AI is bringing a digital transformation to the health-\\ncare industry. Diagnostic Agents: AI agents help analyse\\nvast medical and patient data. Diseases can be predicted by\\nlooking at medical history. This will help improve patient out-\\ncomes and more efficient use of medical resources. Proactive\\nCoordination: They can help automate administrative tasks by\\nproviding 24/7 support, describing prescriptions to patients,\\nand alerting doctors in case of emergency. Agentic AI is also\\naccelerating drug discovery.\\nSignificant research is underway in related fields, including\\nBursy et al. [18], focusing on using gold nanoparticles in diag-\\nnostic agents and drug discovery. In [19], Bottens and Yemada\\ndiscussed using cell-penetrating peptides in diagnostic tools,\\ndrug carriers, and diagnostic agents. To explore these areas\\nmore, one can see [20], where the author has studied agentic\\nAI systems for healthcare transformation.\\nC. AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES: SELF-DRIVING FLEETS,\\nADAPTIVE TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT.\\nAgentic AI is driving progress in intelligent traffic manage-\\nment and autonomous vehicles. By collecting information\\nfrom Google Maps, local events in the city, and traffic rules,\\nand using optimization techniques, Kadkhodayi et al. have\\ndeveloped a method for a real-time traffic management sys-\\ntem [45]. Guo et al. in [46] introduced a Traffic Research\\nAgent for optimizing transportation systems.

It\\ncan help reduce financial expenditure by automating routine\\ntasks. For example, HR processes like shortlisting, selecting\\ncandidates, and onboarding and training new employees can\\nbe automated [27]. Agentic AI can support innovation by\\ncreating and designing new products. Detecting fraudulent\\nactivities and automatically freezing suspicious transactions\\n[22], [23] agentic AI can enhance security.\\nEducation: agentic AI systems are transforming educa-\\ntional systems through autonomous tutoring agents, which\\nare improving learning outcomes and decreasing operational\\ncosts. Autonomous tutors use LLM-based agents to adjust\\nlesson difficulty and vision-related methods to track student\\nengagement [30], [31]. Some AI agents can grade the assign-\\nments and answers by themselves, reducing the grading time\\nand improving feedback quality. Agentic AI can take the role\\nof school administration for class scheduling, mental health\\nimprovement, and play coaching. Using ChatGPT-4 and other\\nAI agents, Paul et al. in [28] have addressed the bullying of\\nthe students and the consequences of this on the students’\\nwell-being. Istrate analysed the impact and limitations of\\neducational AI agents [29].\\nCustomer support: agentic AI enables round-the-clock cus-\\ntomer support by providing intelligent, context-aware re-\\nsponses far beyond traditional rule-based chatbots’ capabil-\\nities. Compared to conventional chatbots with programmed\\nstructures, AI agents can answer complex questions by under-\\nstanding customer emotions if required by searching the web\\nor databases. Conversational agents can search past conver-\\nsations and purchase histories to give dynamic suggestions.\\nUltimately resulting in customer satisfaction. In addition to\\nanswering queries, they can automate routine tasks such as\\nprocessing refunds and scheduling calls with human agents\\n[34], [35]. Advancing this field, Cheng et al. explored how\\nagentic AI facilitates initial customer interactions [32]. Zhang\\net al. investigated the accuracy and speed of AI-generated\\nresponses in customer service environments [33].\\nIT & Cyber Security: agentic AI is revolutionising security\\nby continuously monitoring and identifying security threats.\\nThese proactive agents can immediately block fraudulent\\ntransactions and alert security systems. It quickly knows\\nthe new emerging threats [43]. They can detect predictive\\nmaintenance by noticing if the hardware and software fail.\\nKatnapally et al. used agentic AI and RL to automate cyber\\nthreat response [44].\\nAgentic AI modernizes supply chain management by in-\\ncreasing sustainability and cost efficiency [37]. Xu et al. [38]\\nintroduce autonomous supply chains for greater resilience\\nand flexibility. Using historical data, AI agents can forecast\\nproduct demand [39], [40]. By monitoring traffic and weather,\\nthey can help in real-time rerouting [41]. AI robots are help-\\ning in warehouses with transporting, sorting, and packing\\n[42]. From order placement to delivery, agentic AI systems\\ncan autonomously manage inventory, optimise logistics, track\\nshipments in real-time, resolve delivery exceptions, and per-\\nsonalise customer updates—all without human intervention.\\nHere, we want to add that directly applying reinforcement\\nlearning (RL) policies trained for one domain (e.g., industrial\\nrobotics) or, in general, the learning of one agent in a partic-\\nular environment, to a fundamentally different domain (e.g.,\\nfinancial trading) is generally not feasible due to significant\\ndifferences in environment dynamics, data distributions, and\\nrequired skill sets. Cross-domain knowledge transfer is feasi-\\nble when the task structure is similar (e.g., warehouse robotics\\nand assembly line control). Building modular, generalizable\\nagent architectures is an active research frontier aiming to\\novercome these limitations.\\nVI. IMPACT ON LABOR AND SOCIETY\\nAgentic AI is taking a dramatic leap forward in the labor mar-\\nkets and societal structures. It has already begun reshaping\\nindustries like automobiles, healthcare, and robotics, impact-\\ning the daily lives of human beings. The Fourth Industrial\\nRevolution enables machines to replicate human behavior and\\ntackle complex challenges by integrating AI, robotics, and\\ndata. This change signifies a fundamental shift transforming\\nhow businesses operate and interact with technology. In the\\nfuture, this integration promises both immense benefits and\\nwork efficiency. At the same time, its adoption raises pro-\\nfound challenges about ethical risks, workforce disruption,\\nand security concerns. In the following two sections, we shall\\nfocus on the impact of agentic AI systems on workforce\\ntransformation and ethical risks.\\nA. WORKFORCE TRANSFORMATION: JOB\\nDISPLACEMENT VS. AUGMENTATION.\\nAgentic AI has a dual impact on workforce transformation; it\\ncan displace and augment jobs.\\nJobs displacement [69], [68]: Tasks like packing and\\nlabelling items in the manufacturing industry, data entry,\\nmeeting scheduling in any office-related work, and basic\\ncustomer service-related roles are repetitive and can easily be\\nautomated using agentic AI systems. AI agents are replacing\\nthe mid-level managers who do routine tasks, collapsing the\\ncorporate pyramids. This has enormous economic and so-\\ncial consequences. Adopting agentic AI systems can lead to\\nmass unemployment in some sectors and income inequality\\nin society, as low-skilled workers face the highest risk of\\nworkforce reduction. Frenette and Frank in [97] examined\\nthe risk of automation faced by different groups of workers.\\nTheir report suggests that 10.6% of workers are at high risk\\nbecause of automation jobs. Frennette and Frank in another\\nwork [25] claimed 44.4% of women in the paid workforce\\nfaced a moderate to high risk of job transformation as a result\\nof automation.\\nJob augmentation in work [89]: Imagine in an indus-\\ntry AI agents doing repetitive tasks and freeing humans for\\nstrategic work that will improve productivity. Job augmenta-\\ntion enhances human capabilities rather than replacing them.\\nHumans can use AI to analyze data and make data-driven\\ndecisions. This requires reskilling and upskilling the work-\\nforce. Of course, some jobs will vanish, but others will evolve\\nVOLUME 11, 2023\\n9\\nThis article has been accepted for publication in IEEE Access.

ETHICAL RISKS: BIAS, ACCOUNTABILITY, AND\\nCONTROL\\nAI systems bring several ethical risks, regulatory challenges,\\nand benefits. Below, we discuss and analyze its impacts.\\nBias: As these systems mainly depend on data, data biases\\nor skewed data can amplify the bias in the model. For exam-\\nple, the system can be biased in a job interview if one group is\\nunrepresentative. Sometimes, self-improving agents may de-\\nvelop an unintended bias. Bias outcomes disproportionately\\nharm specific groups. These biases can pose serious risks in\\nhealthcare, security, and other high-stakes domains. While\\ncreating AI systems, we should mitigate biases by debiasing\\ndata, using explainable tools to understand decisions, and\\nensuring human intervention in AI decisions.\\nAccountability: Imagine a diagnostic system predicts can-\\ncer for a noncancerous tumour, then the trauma through which\\nthe victim goes. A self-driving car causes the death of a\\nperson. Who should be blamed in these cases: the developer,\\nthe deployer, the user, or the AI agent? As AI systems start\\nmaking decisions, determining responsibility when things\\ngo wrong becomes complex, and this accountability gap is\\none of the most challenging aspects of AI governance. The\\nincreasing autonomy of agentic AI raises another risk of\\nlosing human control in agentic AI systems. These systems\\nmake final decisions in microseconds without human input.\\nDevelopers should ensure systems permit human intervention\\nand make the decisions interpretable by users. The solutions\\nwill require interdisciplinary collaboration across computer\\nscience, ethics, law, and political science.\\nVII. CURRENT RESEARCH CHALLENGES\\nA. SCALABILITY, INTERPRETABILITY, HUMAN-AI\\nCOLLABORATION, SECURITY THREATS\\nData is the backbone of these AI systems, so data integra-\\ntion becomes a challenge in large enterprises [115]. When\\ndeployed in large-scale and dynamic environments, these\\nagentic AI systems have significant scalability issues. We\\nhave mentioned some of the problems. Computational com-\\nplexity: As data, the number of agents, and model complexity\\ngrow, so do the demands for processing power and memory.\\nCoordination Complexity: As the number of AI agents grows\\nin a MAS, ensuring coordination and competition becomes\\nharder. Scaling AI systems into sensitive areas increases ethi-\\ncal risks. In an extensive system with multiple agents, it is not\\neasy to trace decisions arising from agents and understand\\nthe reason behind those decisions. Oikonomou and Khera\\nin [113] discussed key obstacles to designing scalable AI\\nsystems. Many researchers have tried to address these issues\\nby introducing Hierarchical RL (decomposing complex tasks\\ninto small sub-tasks) – see [117], [116], Edge AI (computa-\\ntions are distributed to local nodes) – see [118], Federated\\nlearning(collaborative without raw data sharing) – see [119].\\nInterpretability in agentic AI systems refers to our ability\\nto understand the decision-making process of AI agents. This\\nbecomes difficult as systems grow in complexity and auton-\\nomy. Here, we mention some of the challenges. Deep learn-\\ning and reinforcement learning, used in agentic AI systems’\\nbrains, operate as black boxes. Simple statistical models are\\ninterpretable but not capable of accomplishing complex tasks.\\nSo, it becomes tough to understand why the specific action is\\nbeing taken. In a MAS, it is unclear which agent is to blame\\nfor a wrong decision. As a result, clinicians, investors, and\\nregulators hesitate to adopt AI without intuitive explanations,\\nslowing deployment in critical sectors. To mitigate these\\nchallenges, researchers are integrating explainable AI (trans-\\nparent and understandable AI decisions) – see [120], [121],\\ninterpretable cognitive architectures (human-like, transparent\\nreasoning frameworks) -see [122], Neurosymbolic AI (which\\ncombines neural and symbolic reasoning) – see [123].\\nDay-to-day human activities are possible because of col-\\nlaboration. AI can be revolutionised only if better collabora-\\ntion between AI and humans exists [124]. Agentic AI has\\nthe capability of making independent decisions and taking\\naction. Humans distrust AI due to past failures or lack of\\ntransparency. Integrating these agents with humans can be\\ncomplex, but careful design can lead to highly effective and\\ncollaborative systems. The best practice will be implement-\\ning hybrid workflows where humans oversee, validate, or\\nintervene in AI-driven processes, especially for critical or\\nhigh-stakes decisions. Investing in explainable AI techniques\\nthat provide a clear, human-readable justification for agentic\\nAI decisions is crucial. While designing these AI systems,\\ndevelopers should ensure that AI agents learn from human\\nfeedback.\\nSecurity threats like adversarial attacks, data leakage, and\\nmisuse of personal data are concerns of agentic AI systems;\\nsee [83], [84]. The autonomy of these systems can bypass\\nsecurity measures, which makes it more vulnerable. Its direct\\naccess to databases may inadvertently expose confidential in-\\nformation, or malicious actors may exploit it to access or ma-\\nnipulate sensitive data. To mitigate these risks, organisations\\nshould prioritise a proactive security strategy. This involves\\ndeploying multi-layered defences, including stringent access\\ncontrols, end-to-end encryption, and real-time monitoring\\nof AI systems. Regular security audits and timely updates\\nare critical to detect and patch vulnerabilities preemptively.\\nFurthermore, raising awareness among AI developers and\\nend-users about emerging security threats in AI and LLM\\napplications remains essential for building a robust security\\nposture.\\nTo solve these problems, Kulothungan has proposed a\\nblockchain-based audit trail for AI decisions to enhance trust\\nand accountability [125]. Chan et al. [67] have emphasized\\nthe continued importance of human responsibility in prevent-\\ning harm from agentic AI systems. As agentic AI systems\\nkeep growing, it is essential to anticipate the emerging harms,\\nincluding systemic effects, weakened collective decision-\\nmaking, and concentrated power, while remaining alert to\\n10\\nVOLUME 11, 2023\\nThis article has been accepted for publication in IEEE Access.

EMERGING TRENDS: AGENTIC AI WITH EMBODIED\\nCOGNITION, LIMITATIONS OF EXISTING APPROACHES.\\nAgentic AI poses challenges like scalability issues, human-AI\\nmisalignment, energy inefficiency, ethical risks, poor inter-\\npretability, and security concerns. \"Today’s challenges bring\\ntomorrow’s innovations,\" so it is essential to identify and\\ntarget the open problems and contribute breakthrough re-\\nsearch to realise agentic AI’s full potential. Below, we have\\nmentioned some challenging open problems in these areas.\\n• Transparent agentic AI: Developing methods that can\\nunderstand causal relationships and emphasize true\\ncause-effect, helping in interpreting the model. See [52],\\n[53]\\n• Neuro-symbolic hybrid agents: seamless integration of\\nneural networks with symbolic logic for interpretable\\nreasoning. See [54], [55].\\n• Multi-agent Cooperation and Negotiation: Enhancing\\ncommunication and coordination in cooperative or com-\\npetitive agent networks. See [56], [57].\\n• Human-AI collaboration: Design agents that adapt to\\nhuman feedback, behaviour, and emotion. See [124],\\n[58].\\n• Energy-efficient agent architectures: Maintaining per-\\nformance while reducing power. See [59], [60].\\n• Simulation-to-Real Transfer (Sim2Real) Bridging the\\ngap between training agents in simulation and deploying\\nthem in the physical world. See [61], [62]\\n• Quantum computing: Quantum machine learning can\\nhelp to learn complex patterns in data, quantum multi-\\nagent reinforcement learning can help in scalability, and\\nparallel and fast computing can be useful in agentic AI\\nsystems. See- [63], [64].\\n• Robustness\\nagainst\\nadversarial\\nattacks:\\nDesigning\\nagents resilient to security threats. See [65], [66].\\nMulti-agent ecosystems must support real-time reasoning,\\ncoordination, and adaptation across numerous agents and\\nmodalities. Consequently, approaches like swarm intelligence\\n[99] and Decentralised Autonomous Organisations (DAOs)\\n[100], [101] are gaining increasing attention. To ensure cost-\\neffective development and deployment, models such as AI-\\nas-a-Service (AIaaS) [102], [103], and systems like BabyAGI\\n[104] present significant business opportunities in the emerg-\\ning agentic AI landscape. On the front of interpretability, new\\ntoolkits such as IBM’s AI Fairness 360 [105] are being devel-\\noped to promote transparency and fairness in AI decisions.\\nThe rise of self-explaining AI, where systems make deci-\\nsions and generate human-understandable justifications for\\ntheir actions, is gaining traction. In this direction, techniques\\nsuch as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting [106], [107]\\nand Explainable Reinforcement Learning (XRL) [108], [109]\\nare becoming increasingly popular. To address the growing\\nconcern of security threats, models are also being hardened\\nagainst adversarial attacks. For instance, Explainable Security\\nhas been proposed by Luca et al. [111], and AI Guardians,\\nintroduced by Kolluri [112], are designed to monitor and\\noversee the behavior of other autonomous agents. Together,\\nscalability, interpretability, and security are not merely techni-\\ncal hurdles—they represent foundational pillars for building\\nsafe, trustworthy, and deployable agentic AI systems in the\\nreal world.\\nCONCLUSION\\nThe evolution of artificial intelligence has followed a remark-\\nable trajectory: first came predictive AI, analysing patterns\\nto forecast outcomes. Next emerged generative AI, creating\\noriginal text, images, and code. Today, we stand at the dawn\\nof agentic AI—a paradigm where systems do not merely\\npredict or generate but act with conversational fluency and\\nautonomous agency. These systems perceive environments,\\nmake context-aware decisions, and adapt through experience,\\nredefining human-machine collaboration.\\nVIII. SUMMARY OF CONTRIBUTIONS\\nAs the sole author of this review paper, we provide a com-\\nprehensive synthesis of agentic AI, systematically analyz-\\ning its core features, technologies, applications, and societal\\nimplications. The paper begins by defining agentic AI and\\ndistinguishing it from traditional assistive AI, then exploring\\nits working principles and diverse types (e.g., reflex, goal-\\nbased, and learning agents). We review key technologies (e.g.,\\nreinforcement learning, multi-agent systems) and methodolo-\\ngies (e.g., BDI frameworks) that enable autonomous decision-\\nmaking alongside real-world applications in robotics, health-\\ncare, and finance. The study critically examines societal im-\\npacts, including job displacement, labor augmentation, and\\nethical risks, while addressing challenges such as scalabil-\\nity, interpretability, and human-AI collaboration. Finally, we\\nhighlight emerging research trends and future opportunities,\\noffering a forward-looking perspective to guide advance-\\nments in the field. This work consolidates fragmented knowl-\\nedge into a unified resource, bridging theoretical foundations\\nwith practical insights for researchers and practitioners.\\nREFERENCES\\n[1] Turing, A.

INTRODUCTION\\nThe roots of agentic AI lie within the broader evolution of\\nartificial intelligence, dating back to early pioneers like Alan\\nTuring [1], who envisioned machines capable of exhibiting\\nintelligent behaviour and learning from experience. Using AI\\nagents for business management dates back to the work [3]\\nin 1998. Early AI systems sought to mimic human decision-\\nmaking but remained tightly constrained by predefined rules,\\nlacking true autonomy. Today, AI has evolved into dynamic\\nnetworks of independent agents capable of collaboration,\\ncompetition, and self-directed action. In the coming sections,\\nwe explore this transformative shift—unpacking the method-\\nologies powering agentic AI and showcasing its real-world\\nimpact.\\nA. WHAT IS AGENTIC AI?

INTRODUCTION\\nThe roots of agentic AI lie within the broader evolution of', 'I. INTRODUCTION\\nThe roots of agentic AI lie within the broader evolution of\\nartificial intelligence, dating back to early pioneers like Alan\\nTuring [1], who envisioned machines capable of exhibiting\\nintelligent behaviour and learning from experience. Using AI\\nagents for business management dates back to the work [3]\\nin 1998. Early AI systems sought to mimic human decision-\\nmaking but remained tightly constrained by predefined rules,\\nlacking true autonomy. Today, AI has evolved into dynamic\\nnetworks of independent agents capable of collaboration,\\ncompetition, and self-directed action. In the coming sections,\\nwe explore this transformative shift—unpacking the method-\\nologies powering agentic AI and showcasing its real-world\\nimpact.\\nA. WHAT IS AGENTIC AI? HOW IS IT DIFFERENT FROM\\nTRADITIONAL AI?\\nLet us begin with an example. Evolution of image classifica-\\ntion: from human labels to agentic AI. We will start with an\\nexample of classifying an image as a cat or dog. In early times,', 'example of classifying an image as a cat or dog. In early times,\\nhumans manually labeled images, an example of a fully hu-\\nman process. Then came assistive AI, such as Convolutional\\nNeural Networks (CNNs), which, once trained on labelled\\ndata, can automatically identify whether an image shows a\\ncat or a dog, see [36]. This is called \"assistive\" because the\\nAI supports human efforts—it performs a task when guided\\nand trained by humans but does not act independently. How-\\never, these models require human-labelled data and human\\nintervention for updates. Once deployed, assistive AI systems\\ncannot adapt or learn independently.\\nNow imagine agentic AI— in this context, an agentic AI\\ncould search the web for new data, adapt to new classes like\\n\"fox\" without explicit human retraining, and refine its model\\nusing techniques like reinforcement learning. This kind of AI\\ngoes beyond assisting—it acts with a degree of autonomy and\\ncan operate in dynamic environments with minimal human\\ninput.', \"can operate in dynamic environments with minimal human\\ninput.\\nIf we had to define agentic AI in one word, it would\\nbe ’proactivity’—the ability to anticipate, initiate, and act\\nautonomously toward goals.

Traditional AI systems are\\ntypically constrained by predefined rules and exhibit limited\\nadaptability, making them well-suited for narrow, single-task\\napplications. In contrast, agentic AI transcends simple reac-\\ntive behaviour by understanding complex environments, de-\\nvising multi-step plans, and autonomously pursuing defined\\ngoals. This proactive and strategic capability enables agentic\\nAI to effectively address dynamic, real-world challenges.\\nAs demonstrated by [2], such systems represent a signifi-\\ncant advancement over conventional AI verified by collected', 'cant advancement over conventional AI verified by collected\\ninformation from around 500 organisations, with a 34.2%\\nreduction in completing the task, increasing the accuracy by\\n7.7%, and improving the resource utilisation by 13.6%.\\nCriteria\\nTraditional AI\\nAgentic AI\\nTask assignment\\nsolves task assigned\\nby human\\nsolves a task instead of\\nhuman\\nAutonomy\\nfollows\\npredefined\\ntasks\\nautonomous and able\\nto make decisions\\nLearning capability\\nlimited\\nlearning\\nby\\ntraining data\\ncontinuous and evolv-\\ning\\nBehavior\\nreactive\\nproactive\\nInput dependency\\nmanual input required\\nself initiating\\nScope\\nsingle task focused\\norchestrated\\nworkflows\\nTABLE 1. Difference between Traditional AI and agentic AI\\nB. CONFUSION BETWEEN AI AGENTS AND AGENTIC AI.\\nThe confusion between AI agents and agentic AI stems from\\ntheir hierarchical relationship [94]: AI agents are specialised\\ncomponents designed to perform single tasks. Agentic AI is\\nan autonomous system that dynamically orchestrates multiple', 'an autonomous system that dynamically orchestrates multiple\\nagents to achieve broader goals. For example, an AI agent\\nin medical imaging might be a CNN that classifies tumours\\nin scans—nothing more. In contrast, an agentic AI system\\nwould integrate multiple such agents (e.g., one fetching pa-\\ntient history, another cross-validating MRI and X-ray results,\\nand a third alerting doctors) into a cohesive, goal-driven\\npipeline. Think of AI agents as bricks and agentic AI as the\\nentire house: the former perform fixed tasks, while the latter\\ndynamically coordinates and adapts those tasks to achieve\\ncomplex objectives, such as end-to-end diagnosis. Agentic\\nAI is a unified platform that seamlessly connects AI agents\\nwith human users to facilitate smooth collaboration. Adaptive\\ntools and dynamic services enable AI systems to learn, adapt,\\nand work together, significantly enhancing their capacity to\\naddress complex, real-world problems.

We analyze how autonomous decision-\\nmaking technologies evolve, where they deploy, and what\\ntheir consequences are for human systems.\\nII. LITERATURE SURVEY\\nAgentic AI does not need human intervention or works with\\nminimal human intervention. Another way to describe agentic\\nAI is autonomous AI, which can set goals, make decisions,\\nand take actions independently to achieve a goal or com-\\nplete a task without human intervention. Despite its grow-\\ning significance, from autonomous research agents to self-\\noptimising business processes, there remains a striking lack\\nof readily available and understandable materials dedicated to\\nthe subject.

FOUNDATIONS OF AGENTIC AI\\nAgentic AI systems are built on core capabilities like au-\\ntonomy, adaptability, and goal-orientated plans. These agents\\noperate through perception, reasoning, action, and collabora-\\ntion. They are categorized by functionality—reactive, goal-\\nbased, utility-driven, and self-improving—each with distinct\\noperational paradigms.\\nA.

This self-sufficient operation trans-\\nforms the car from a passive machine into an active agent on\\nthe road.\\nAdaptability takes this further by enabling continuous\\nimprovement through experience. When a self-driving car en-\\ncounters slippery road conditions that nearly cause a collision,\\nit does not just record the incident—it actively updates its\\ndriving models to account for reduced traction. The next time\\nit detects rain or ice, it automatically adjusts its behaviour by\\nincreasing following distances, braking earlier, or avoiding\\nsharp turns.

The system does not just follow a fixed route when\\ngiven a destination. It integrates map information with live\\ntraffic updates. If the road is blocked, the car finds alternative\\npaths while maintaining the original objective.\\nB. HOW DO AI AGENTS WORK?\\nAgentic AI operation is described through different phase-\\nbased models—some outline four phases (data collection →\\ndecision →learning →collaboration), while others break it\\ninto five (perceive →reason →act →learn →collaborate).\\nThese variations are functionally equivalent, not contradic-\\ntory. ‘Perception’ encompasses data collection and interpreta-\\ntion, while ‘decision-making’ combines reasoning and action.\\nFor simplicity, we will adopt the four-phase framework in\\nour discussion. Agentic AI collects data, makes decisions\\nFIGURE 2. Agentic AI working\\nautonomously, and adapts to new inputs—a core mantra we', 'FIGURE 2. Agentic AI working\\nautonomously, and adapts to new inputs—a core mantra we\\nhave reiterated to underscore its transformative nature. Now,\\nlet us dive deeper: how does it work?\\nStep 1: Data collection – Agentic AI continuously mon-\\nitors its environment, collecting data—be it text, images, or\\nreal-world signals—that align with its goals. Just as a self-\\ndriving car uses LiDAR and cameras to perceive its surround-\\nings, agentic AI employs large language models (LLMs)\\n[4] and natural language processing (NLP) to interpret and\\ncontextualise information, converting raw inputs into mean-\\ningful, actionable insights.\\nStep 2: Decision Making – Once information is collected,\\nagentic AI evaluates the context and determines the most\\nappropriate action. For instance, a self-driving car processes\\nreal-time data—such as a pedestrian suddenly entering the\\nroad or slippery conditions from wet pavement—to decide\\nwhether to brake, change lanes, or notify the passenger. It can', 'whether to brake, change lanes, or notify the passenger. It can\\nalso explain its reasoning through onboard displays or voice\\nfeedback, enhancing transparency.\\nStep 3: Learning- Agentic AI continuously improves\\nthrough experience. Over time, its responses become more\\naccurate and reliable. A self-driving system, for example,\\nrefines its behaviour by analysing near-miss events, adapting\\nto local driving habits (e.g., aggressive vs. cautious traffic),\\nand updating its risk models after each journey to minimise\\nfalse positives and ensure smoother operation.\\nStep 4: collaboration - Agentic AI goes beyond perform-\\ning isolated tasks—it facilitates collaboration among multi-\\nple AI agents and fosters meaningful interaction with hu-\\nman users. This stage emphasises coordinated behaviour and\\nhuman-AI synergy. In the context of self-driving cars, for ex-\\nample, a fleet of autonomous vehicles shares real-time infor-\\nmation—such as accidents or traffic conditions—through a', 'mation—such as accidents or traffic conditions—through a\\ndecentralised network. This collective awareness allows each\\ncar to reroute and optimise navigation proactively. Passengers\\nare informed through timely alerts like \"Traffic congestion\\nahead—rerouting to a faster path.\"\\nThese four phases—data collection, decision-making,\\nlearning, and collaboration create a self-sustaining loop of\\nautonomous intelligence. Much like a self-driving car that\\nbecomes more adept with every mile and enriches a broader\\ninnovative mobility ecosystem, agentic AI evolves through\\nongoing interaction with its environment and exchanging\\ninsights across systems.\\nC. DIFFERENT TYPES OF AI AGENTS IN AN AGENTIC AI\\nSYSTEM\\nThere are different ways of classifying agentic AI systems.\\nOne can classify according to architecture, learning capacity,\\ninteraction paradigm, or domain specialisations.\\nArchitecture-based classification categorizes agentic AI\\nsystems based on their underlying decision-making frame-', \"systems based on their underlying decision-making frame-\\nworks. Reflex agents work with predefined rules and do not\\nremember past actions.

Next are the model-based agents,\\nwhich maintain an internal model to handle the observations.\\nFor example, considering the recent traffic, a self-driving\\ncar learns to keep the distance between other vehicles. Then\\ncome the goal-based agents, which plan actions to achieve\\nobjectives.

Vehicles can choose the shortest path to reach destina-\\ntions. The next one is utility-based agents, which extend the\\ngoal-based agents but choose actions that maximize expected\\nutility, e.g., profit, time, fuel cost, etc. Here, not only is it\\nconsidered the shortest path, but it also takes time, comfort,\\ntraffic, and everything else into consideration while driving.\\nLearning agents improve performance autonomously through\\nreinforcement learning. Can learn self-parking, using a his-\\ntory of passenger behaviours, considering travel time. The\\nlast one is meta-reasoning agents, which can modify their\\nlearning process and choose different algorithms and best\\nhyperparameters. Can handle unseen scenarios like off-road\\ndriving to avoid real-time traffic.\\nFIGURE 3. Classification of AI agents\\nAI agents are also classified according to the interac-', 'FIGURE 3. Classification of AI agents\\nAI agents are also classified according to the interac-\\ntion paradigm: how they engage with other agents and\\nhumans.

More complex agentic AI systems where\\nmultiple agents interact in either hierarchical (top-to-down)\\nor flat (peer-to-peer) are called multi-agent systems. These\\nsystems suit more complicated challenges like maintaining\\nsupply chain management and coordinating centrally with\\nAI agents.

This\\nis particularly useful when defining explicit reward functions\\nis challenging, such as learning driving habits by observing\\nhuman drivers.\\nImitation learning(IL) plays a pivotal role in building\\nagentic AI systems; see [48], [49], [130], and [132].

METHODOLOGIES IN AGENTIC AI SYSTEMS\\nAgent design frameworks: Sometimes agentic AI systems\\nare built using formal architectures. We will note a few of\\nthem. Belief Desire Intention(BDI) is a framework where\\nhuman reasoning inspires decision-making; see [77], [78].\\nHere, beliefs represent knowledge, desires are goals, and\\nintentions are committed plans. It excels in handling com-\\nplex, goal-directed behavior in dynamic environments, trans-\\nparent reasoning, enhanced learning, and easy integration\\nof AI techniques. However, BDI faces scalability issues as\\nagent populations grow, and implementing effective decision-\\nmaking in complex, uncertain environments remains chal-\\nlenging. Typical use cases include autonomous robots, digital', 'lenging. Typical use cases include autonomous robots, digital\\nassistants, and multi-agent coordination tasks where explain-\\nability and rational planning are crucial. SOAR is a rule-\\nbased architecture designed for general intelligence, inte-\\ngrating learning, problem-solving, and decision-making in a\\nunified system; see [74], [75] and [76]. SOAR is a rule-based\\narchitecture for cognitive modeling, supporting hierarchical\\ntask decomposition. Its strengths lie in structured knowledge\\nrepresentation and efficient task execution. It lacks flexibil-\\nity in uncertain and large-scale environments and requires\\nextensive manual rule engineering, making it computation-\\nally inefficient. SOAR is often applied in training simula-\\ntions and procedural task automation. Adaptive Control of\\nThought—Rational (ACT-R) is a cognitive architecture that\\nmodels human thought processes by integrating symbolic and\\nsub-symbolic computations to simulate perception, memory,', 'sub-symbolic computations to simulate perception, memory,\\ndecision-making, and learning; see [79], [80]. It has a declar-\\native memory (for factual knowledge), a procedural mem-\\nory (containing production rules), a buffer (for temporary\\nstorage of information), modules (for perception, action, and\\noperation), and a sub-symbolic process (governs learning and\\ndecision-making). The psychologically plausible and hybrid\\napproach of combining symbolic and sub-symbolic reason-\\ning are the strengths of ACT-R. ACT-R is computationally\\nexpensive, and it struggles when rapid responses are needed.\\nThey are used in cognitive modeling, human-computer inter-\\naction, and human-like AI agents. ACT-R is primarily used in\\nresearch.\\nSimulation and training environments: Agentic AI sys-\\ntems require extensive training in safe and controlled environ-\\nments before being deployed in the real world. The goal is to\\naccelerate learning, minimize real-world risks, and minimize', 'accelerate learning, minimize real-world risks, and minimize\\nethical concerns by exploring, experimenting, and learning\\nfrom mistakes before real-world experimentation.

IMPACT ON LABOR AND SOCIETY\\nAgentic AI is taking a dramatic leap forward in the labor mar-\\nkets and societal structures. It has already begun reshaping\\nindustries like automobiles, healthcare, and robotics, impact-\\ning the daily lives of human beings. The Fourth Industrial\\nRevolution enables machines to replicate human behavior and\\ntackle complex challenges by integrating AI, robotics, and\\ndata. This change signifies a fundamental shift transforming\\nhow businesses operate and interact with technology. In the\\nfuture, this integration promises both immense benefits and\\nwork efficiency.

In the following two sections, we shall\\nfocus on the impact of agentic AI systems on workforce\\ntransformation and ethical risks.\\nA. WORKFORCE TRANSFORMATION: JOB\\nDISPLACEMENT VS. AUGMENTATION.\\nAgentic AI has a dual impact on workforce transformation; it\\ncan displace and augment jobs.\\nJobs displacement [69], [68]: Tasks like packing and\\nlabelling items in the manufacturing industry, data entry,\\nmeeting scheduling in any office-related work, and basic\\ncustomer service-related roles are repetitive and can easily be\\nautomated using agentic AI systems. AI agents are replacing\\nthe mid-level managers who do routine tasks, collapsing the\\ncorporate pyramids. This has enormous economic and so-\\ncial consequences. Adopting agentic AI systems can lead to\\nmass unemployment in some sectors and income inequality', 'mass unemployment in some sectors and income inequality\\nin society, as low-skilled workers face the highest risk of\\nworkforce reduction.

Frennette and Frank in another\\nwork [25] claimed 44.4% of women in the paid workforce\\nfaced a moderate to high risk of job transformation as a result\\nof automation.\\nJob augmentation in work [89]: Imagine in an indus-\\ntry AI agents doing repetitive tasks and freeing humans for\\nstrategic work that will improve productivity.

ETHICAL RISKS: BIAS, ACCOUNTABILITY, AND\\nCONTROL\\nAI systems bring several ethical risks, regulatory challenges,\\nand benefits. Below, we discuss and analyze its impacts.\\nBias: As these systems mainly depend on data, data biases\\nor skewed data can amplify the bias in the model. For exam-\\nple, the system can be biased in a job interview if one group is\\nunrepresentative. Sometimes, self-improving agents may de-\\nvelop an unintended bias. Bias outcomes disproportionately\\nharm specific groups. These biases can pose serious risks in\\nhealthcare, security, and other high-stakes domains. While\\ncreating AI systems, we should mitigate biases by debiasing\\ndata, using explainable tools to understand decisions, and', 'data, using explainable tools to understand decisions, and\\nensuring human intervention in AI decisions.\\nAccountability: Imagine a diagnostic system predicts can-\\ncer for a noncancerous tumour, then the trauma through which\\nthe victim goes.

As AI systems start\\nmaking decisions, determining responsibility when things\\ngo wrong becomes complex, and this accountability gap is\\none of the most challenging aspects of AI governance. The\\nincreasing autonomy of agentic AI raises another risk of\\nlosing human control in agentic AI systems. These systems\\nmake final decisions in microseconds without human input.\\nDevelopers should ensure systems permit human intervention\\nand make the decisions interpretable by users. The solutions\\nwill require interdisciplinary collaboration across computer\\nscience, ethics, law, and political science.', 'science, ethics, law, and political science.\\nVII. CURRENT RESEARCH CHALLENGES\\nA. SCALABILITY, INTERPRETABILITY, HUMAN-AI\\nCOLLABORATION, SECURITY THREATS\\nData is the backbone of these AI systems, so data integra-\\ntion becomes a challenge in large enterprises [115]. When\\ndeployed in large-scale and dynamic environments, these\\nagentic AI systems have significant scalability issues. We\\nhave mentioned some of the problems. Computational com-\\nplexity: As data, the number of agents, and model complexity\\ngrow, so do the demands for processing power and memory.\\nCoordination Complexity: As the number of AI agents grows\\nin a MAS, ensuring coordination and competition becomes\\nharder. Scaling AI systems into sensitive areas increases ethi-\\ncal risks. In an extensive system with multiple agents, it is not\\neasy to trace decisions arising from agents and understand\\nthe reason behind those decisions. Oikonomou and Khera\\nin [113] discussed key obstacles to designing scalable AI', 'in [113] discussed key obstacles to designing scalable AI\\nsystems. Many researchers have tried to address these issues\\nby introducing Hierarchical RL (decomposing complex tasks\\ninto small sub-tasks) – see [117], [116], Edge AI (computa-\\ntions are distributed to local nodes) – see [118], Federated\\nlearning(collaborative without raw data sharing) – see [119].\\nInterpretability in agentic AI systems refers to our ability\\nto understand the decision-making process of AI agents. This\\nbecomes difficult as systems grow in complexity and auton-\\nomy. Here, we mention some of the challenges. Deep learn-\\ning and reinforcement learning, used in agentic AI systems’\\nbrains, operate as black boxes. Simple statistical models are\\ninterpretable but not capable of accomplishing complex tasks.\\nSo, it becomes tough to understand why the specific action is\\nbeing taken. In a MAS, it is unclear which agent is to blame\\nfor a wrong decision. As a result, clinicians, investors, and', 'for a wrong decision. As a result, clinicians, investors, and\\nregulators hesitate to adopt AI without intuitive explanations,\\nslowing deployment in critical sectors. To mitigate these\\nchallenges, researchers are integrating explainable AI (trans-\\nparent and understandable AI decisions) – see [120], [121],\\ninterpretable cognitive architectures (human-like, transparent\\nreasoning frameworks) -see [122], Neurosymbolic AI (which\\ncombines neural and symbolic reasoning) – see [123].\\nDay-to-day human activities are possible because of col-\\nlaboration. AI can be revolutionised only if better collabora-\\ntion between AI and humans exists [124]. Agentic AI has\\nthe capability of making independent decisions and taking\\naction. Humans distrust AI due to past failures or lack of\\ntransparency. Integrating these agents with humans can be\\ncomplex, but careful design can lead to highly effective and\\ncollaborative systems. The best practice will be implement-', 'collaborative systems. The best practice will be implement-\\ning hybrid workflows where humans oversee, validate, or\\nintervene in AI-driven processes, especially for critical or\\nhigh-stakes decisions. Investing in explainable AI techniques\\nthat provide a clear, human-readable justification for agentic\\nAI decisions is crucial. While designing these AI systems,\\ndevelopers should ensure that AI agents learn from human\\nfeedback.\\nSecurity threats like adversarial attacks, data leakage, and\\nmisuse of personal data are concerns of agentic AI systems;\\nsee [83], [84]. The autonomy of these systems can bypass\\nsecurity measures, which makes it more vulnerable. Its direct\\naccess to databases may inadvertently expose confidential in-\\nformation, or malicious actors may exploit it to access or ma-\\nnipulate sensitive data. To mitigate these risks, organisations\\nshould prioritise a proactive security strategy. This involves\\ndeploying multi-layered defences, including stringent access', 'deploying multi-layered defences, including stringent access\\ncontrols, end-to-end encryption, and real-time monitoring\\nof AI systems. Regular security audits and timely updates\\nare critical to detect and patch vulnerabilities preemptively.\\nFurthermore, raising awareness among AI developers and\\nend-users about emerging security threats in AI and LLM\\napplications remains essential for building a robust security\\nposture.\\nTo solve these problems, Kulothungan has proposed a\\nblockchain-based audit trail for AI decisions to enhance trust\\nand accountability [125]. Chan et al. [67] have emphasized\\nthe continued importance of human responsibility in prevent-\\ning harm from agentic AI systems. As agentic AI systems\\nkeep growing, it is essential to anticipate the emerging harms,\\nincluding systemic effects, weakened collective decision-\\nmaking, and concentrated power, while remaining alert to\\n10\\nVOLUME 11, 2023', \"making, and concentrated power, while remaining alert to\\n10\\nVOLUME 11, 2023\\nThis article has been accepted for publication in IEEE Access.

Consequently, approaches like swarm intelligence\\n[99] and Decentralised Autonomous Organisations (DAOs)\\n[100], [101] are gaining increasing attention. To ensure cost-\\neffective development and deployment, models such as AI-\\nas-a-Service (AIaaS) [102], [103], and systems like BabyAGI\\n[104] present significant business opportunities in the emerg-\\ning agentic AI landscape. On the front of interpretability, new\\ntoolkits such as IBM’s AI Fairness 360 [105] are being devel-\\noped to promote transparency and fairness in AI decisions.\\nThe rise of self-explaining AI, where systems make deci-\\nsions and generate human-understandable justifications for\\ntheir actions, is gaining traction. In this direction, techniques\\nsuch as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting [106], [107]\\nand Explainable Reinforcement Learning (XRL) [108], [109]', 'and Explainable Reinforcement Learning (XRL) [108], [109]\\nare becoming increasingly popular. To address the growing\\nconcern of security threats, models are also being hardened\\nagainst adversarial attacks. For instance, Explainable Security\\nhas been proposed by Luca et al. [111], and AI Guardians,\\nintroduced by Kolluri [112], are designed to monitor and\\noversee the behavior of other autonomous agents. Together,\\nscalability, interpretability, and security are not merely techni-\\ncal hurdles—they represent foundational pillars for building\\nsafe, trustworthy, and deployable agentic AI systems in the\\nreal world.\\nCONCLUSION\\nThe evolution of artificial intelligence has followed a remark-\\nable trajectory: first came predictive AI, analysing patterns\\nto forecast outcomes. Next emerged generative AI, creating\\noriginal text, images, and code. Today, we stand at the dawn\\nof agentic AI—a paradigm where systems do not merely\\npredict or generate but act with conversational fluency and', 'predict or generate but act with conversational fluency and\\nautonomous agency. These systems perceive environments,\\nmake context-aware decisions, and adapt through experience,\\nredefining human-machine collaboration.\\nVIII.
